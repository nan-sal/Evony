# SVS Guide

> Here is a summary of the SVS guide.

1. **Enhancing Subordinate City Debuffs**
   * Equip the Akeames 6-gear set, which has 2 debuff abilities.
   * Equip all subordinate city generals with beasts that have debuff abilities.
   * In my case, I am prioritizing raising the red-star subordinate city generals.
     * I have completed 10 stars for Empress Dowager Cixi and Nero, and am now working on Jackson.

2. **Achieve at least 2.25M points in each SvS to collect the 5th specialization fragment.**
   * üí° When you cross over to the enemy server, you have a default 5-minute shield. During this time, it's not difficult to achieve 2.25M points by hunting level 10-12 monsters.
     * ‚ú® However, the default 5-minute shield is immediately removed the moment you scout or attack. It remains active when hunting monsters, visiting the Ares statue, or visiting the Fire Sprit.
   * üí° Complete the 1st to 3rd specializations for the main and assistant defense generals, so that you can attach the 5th specialization, **"Battle-Tested"** which boosts total troop attack by "+500 x 2" and helps the T1 cavalry flats.
   * ‚ú® Although many subordinates cities are unoccupied, some may have troops. You can score points by attacking those with troops.
   
3. **Organize Favorites**
   * Delete all unnecessary favorites and mark enemy alliance cities as favorites the day before or on the day of SvS.
   * Mark a return point as a favorite before crossing over to the enemy server.

4. **Fill the Hospital**
   * Fill the hospital with T1 troops, so if troops are lost in SvS, you can revive them using the **Source of Life** item.
   * If the hospital is not filled, high-tier troops will fill it in order of loss, and you will need resources to revive them.
   * While T1 cavalry ghosting well, you can still fill the hospital with T1. But if you don't have many cavalry or if ghosting is slow, you might also consider filling the hospital with high-tier cavalry.
     * This way, you save Source of Life but use resources to revive troops.
     * The advantage of the hospital is that you can selectively revive troops.üëç
     * With Source of Life, the order of revival is fixed ü•≤ and you may have to revive high-tier troops even if you don't want to yet.
     * If you can't revive troops in time with the Source of Life, they will disappear, but consider that troops in the hospital can be revived with resources even after SvS ends.

5. **Use the Bunker**
   * At Lv37, with a Super Officer, the bunker can protect 740,000 troops.
   * Troops in the bunker are protected for 12 hours. Renew this protection every 12 hours.
   * It's advisable to place high-tier cavalry in the bunker.

6. **Defense Battles**
   * When attacking empty castles or subordinate cities, you may be deliberately targeted by users... If the user is not rallying and is reasonable, let them hit you once, and quickly warp back to your server to use a shield.
   * For determining a suitable user to defend, it's a good idea to experience solo defense multiple times on the battlefield and judge how many keeps an attacker would need to defend against.
     * In my case, the attacks from K41 users are manageable, but the solo attacks from K42 and above users are slightly challenging.
   * Always avoid rallies.
   * üí° When attacking empty castles or subordinate cities, make sure not to take subordinate cities with you.
     * When attacking an empty castle, if an enemy attacks your main city, the generals of the subordinate city are out attacking, so you can't utilize debuffs when defending the main city.

7. **Offensive Battles**
   * My offensive strength isn't great, so I don't have much to say... üòÖ However, remember that while there are many strong users on the enemy server, there are also many weaker ones. Be prepared to quickly cross over and attack when you see a vulnerable, unbubbled user. üòÖ
   * During the weekend, while checking your marked enemy server alliance cities, you may find unbubbled users. Quickly attack them and warp back to our server to use a shield.

8. **The Best Time to Get SvS Wings**
   * When the Chalons battle is ongoing, up to 10 SvS Wings rewards are given... this seems to be the best time.
   * Even top 1 alliance users don't seem to fight hard during Chalons battle periods.

9. **Regarding Negative Points**
   * If the score difference between the enemy server and our server is small, and SvS is about to end, it‚Äôs best to avoid risks.
   * However, if it‚Äôs the early stage of SvS or if there's a significant score gap, it‚Äôs good to take risks.
   * While it's better to earn positive points, even if you get negative points but significantly damage the enemy, it can be worth it.
     * e.g., When you earn 500M positive points but get 600-700M negative points.

Gaining wings in SvS is not easy, but with attention to these details and some luck, you will surely achieve it. üëç
